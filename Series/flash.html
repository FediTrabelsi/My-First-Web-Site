              <b  class="m1">Story</b>
              <p>Barry Allen is a Central City police forensic scientist with a reasonably happy life, despite the childhood trauma of a mysterious red and yellow lightning killing his mother and framing his father. All that changes when a massive particle accelerator accident leads to Barry being struck by lightning in his lab. Coming out of coma nine months later, Barry and his new friends at S.T.A.R labs find that he now has the ability to move at superhuman speed. Furthermore, Barry learns that he is but one of many affected by that event, most of whom are using their powers for evil. Determined to make a difference, Barry dedicates his life to fighting such threats, as The Flash. While he gains allies he never expected, there are also secret forces determined to aid and manipulate him for their own agenda.</p>

              <b class="m1">Relation to CW universe</b>
              <p>Forget about the grim Gotham over on Fox or the gross splatter on Netflix. The Flash reflects Barry Allen's sunnier, more innocent personality—a superhero you can feel good about. This show feels positively old-fashioned at times, a place where unabashedly good heroes battle nefariously villainous villains. Sure, maybe Barry experiences the occasional moment of self-doubt or deals with a moral quandary or two. (He'll even steal some civilian clothes from time to time when he forgets to bring a fresh set with him.) But despite his mother's death, there's no tortured soul lurking inside that red hero's outfit of his, no simmering gothic ennui. This guy's a hero without an asterisk, a Central City denizen who is as good as they come, at least on the screen.
			Of course Barry has a significant other, and many of his fellow crimefighters dip their toes into the romantic stream. Foul language can sometimes flit through the script. And The Flash, like all superhero properties, shows us flurries of violence; people sometimes get hurt or even die. But in a television landscape filled with dark antiheroes, the Flash still feels like a bright guy who always tries to do the right thing ... right now.

              <b class="m1">Production</b>
              <p >On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Arrow co-creators Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, Arrow pilot director David Nutter, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns would develop a television series based on the Flash for The CW, and it would detail Barry Allen's origin.[25] Kreisberg revealed after the announcement that Allen would first appear as a recurring character on Arrow in three episodes of season two—all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns—and the last of the episodes would act as a backdoor pilot for the new show. Kreisberg added that Allen would be a forensic scientist and the introduction of his superpowers, as well as the reactions to this, will be very human and grounded. Johns stated that the character of the Flash in the show would resemble his comic book counterpart, complete with his trademark red costume, and not be a poor imitation. Kreisberg elaborated: "No sweat suits or strange code names; he will be The Flash." While researching the best way to depict the Flash's lightning speed, Johns stated it would not just be the standard "blurring around"</p>

              <b class="m1">Final thoughts</b>
              <p>Maybe CW has taken it upon itself to ruin a great character from the DC Universe!!! Probably a child who has never been exposed to genres of movies which never make people think would enjoy this. A show full of stupid plot holes and unnecessary nagging in the form of emotions.... Worthless emotions are given importance rather than good character building and meaningful backstories. Literally the viewership would spike if they kill off stupid emotions and IRIS WEST and bring in some meaningful story.You can write about “The Flash” as a comic-book show or a superhero show, but it makes just as much sense to write about it as a Greg Berlanti show.

Mr. Berlanti doesn’t get the attention that goes to one-show-at-a-time auteurs like Vince Gilligan and Matt Weiner, and he’ll probably never turn out a series like “Breaking Bad” or “Mad Men.” But he and his company, Berlanti Productions, make a lot of television, and they don’t turn out duds. “Everwood,” “Dirty Sexy Money,” “Eli Stone,” “No Ordinary Family,” “Brothers & Sisters,” the underrated “Golden Boy,” “Arrow”: in terms of light, dependable mainstream television, that list reflects a high level of quality control.

And “The Flash,” beginning on Tuesday night on CW, is a good match for his style. (Mr. Berlanti is an executive producer of the show and a writer of the pilot.) Barry Allen, the man given superspeed when he’s hit by lightning, has gone through the usual bizarre tragedies in almost 60 years of comic-book life, but he hasn’t gotten the attention of a Batman or a Wolverine. You can bring him to the screen without the accumulated angst, and that’s what the wholly entertaining pilot for “The Flash” does.
